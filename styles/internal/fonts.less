// All Font Definitions
//

// These fonts must all be defined here, rather than in each related skin file due to the way that
// skins are composed by LESS into the each component. If these were to be imported at the top of
// "variables" files, for example, the import or @font-face rules would be written inside the
// components' root selector (illegal location for these rules). If it's placed instead into the
// "skin.less" file, the rules will be stamped out as many times as the skin file is imported (one
// for each component), too many times.
//
// The result of placing them all in this location is both good and bad. Each file is only imported
// once, but each file is always imported, regardless of the current skin. A JS solution that
// dynamically imports these files (adds them to the LESS or the HEAD of the document) may be
// necessary to truly optimize this font download/installing process. That brings its own set of
// concerns like more JavaScript skin dependency and more places to update when changes occur, and
// a render delay or hiccup when a switch is preformed if the font hasn't been downloaded yet.
